Human-AI Collaboration Peer feedback is an effective pedagogical strategy for improving argumentative writing, yet the integration of generative AI as a collaborator into this process remains underexplored. This study examines how AI-directed (explicit revisions) and AI-assisted (implicit suggestions and encouragement) peer feedback affect argumentative writing and feedback characteristics through an experiment among 90 university students. Content analysis revealed that AI-supported peer feedback enhances elaboration of writing. Epistemic Network Analysis showed that AI-assisted condition fostered integration of cognitive (problem identification, elaboration) and affective (mitigation, hedging) elements, whereas AI-directed condition yielded more structured, task-focused revisions. These findings highlight the impacts of AI support on peer feedback characteristics and argumentative writing, underscoring the importance of cognitive efficiency and socio-emotional engagement in AI-supported peer feedback.\nAERA: American Educational Research Association.\n2025 # ISLS Annual Meeting 2025, Helsinki, Finland ISLS Symposia: “Learners’ Collaboration with AI in Enhancing Peer Feedback Literacy” (with Wenli Chen, Qianru Lyu, Lishan Zheng).

Economics of Education As global economy transitions into digital era, generative AI is sparking concerns over job displacement and triggering risk-averse decision-making among college entrance exam candidates regarding their major choices, to whom existing research pays inadequate attention. This study introduces a novel perspective by using O*NET, NCEE, and population surveys to calculate major-level employment substitution rates. We reveal that the emergence of ChatGPT notably decreased admission scores due to heightened job displacement risks, particularly in STEM majors and Tier 1 colleges, and further investigate its demand-supply mechanism in job postings and graduate surveys. Our findings withstand extensive robustness checks, offering new insights into the dynamics of education and labor markets, enhancing human capital theory, and informing policies for optimizing educational resource allocations.\n2024 # BERA Annual Meeting and WERA Focal Meeting 2024, Manchester, UK BERA Individual Paper, Session Chair: “Research on the Influence Mechanism of Self-Regulated Learning Behaviors on Second Language Learning”.

We demonstrate how automation reshapes skill demands, career paths, education policies, and labor market structures in China and globally, offering fresh insights into the economics of education and labor economics.\nWorking Papers # Generative AI and Human Capital Investment: Evidence from College Major Choice in China (with Peikang Zhang)\nEconomics of Education Using unique administrative data on Chinese college admissions (2020–2024) and a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, we provide the first evidence that generative AI significantly reduces admission scores for AI-exposed majors, especially among students from non-poverty counties, highlighting shifts in human capital investments and labor market implications.\nStudents’ Verbal Interaction Patterns in Collaborative Learning: The Role of Group Awareness (with Wenli Chen, Lishan Zheng)\nComputer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) Using lag sequential analysis (LSA) and sequential pattern mining (SPM), we provide evidence that group awareness tools foster structured transitions and richer sequential patterns, enhancing task coordination and reducing negotiation cycles.\nExploring Collaborative Behavior Differences Between High and Low Performing Groups with Group Awareness Support: Using Gaze and Interaction Behavior (with Wenli Chen, Lishan Zheng)\nComputer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) Using multimodal analysis combining verbal interaction and eye-tracking data, this study finds that high-performing groups, supported by group awareness tools, exhibit longer fixation durations on individual/partner contributions, efficient verbal patterns (e.g., idea offering → negotiation), and productive inquiry cycles, compared with low-performing groups.\nThe Impact of Automation on the Demand for Specific Skills: Evidence Based on Real Interview Experience (with Peikang Zhang)\nEconomics of Education This study analyses job-search behaviour using interview-experience posts from kanzhun.com to examine how automation shapes skill demand. We compile over 210,000 posts covering 3,729 large employers (2009–2023). Firms with higher automation intensity place greater emphasis on analytical skills and tend to conduct more demanding written tests and more socially oriented interview. These requirements feature tasks less amenable to automation, therefore exhibiting lower pass rates and higher perceived difficulty reported by interviewees.\n","date":"1 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/xuanyuchen.github.io/posts/research/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Research","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/xuanyuchen.github.io/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/xuanyuchen.github.io/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/xuanyuchen.github.io/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/xuanyuchen.github.io/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
