Human-AI Collaboration Peer feedback is an effective pedagogical strategy for improving argumentative writing, yet the integration of generative AI as a collaborator into this process remains underexplored. This study examines how AI-directed (explicit revisions) and AI-assisted (implicit suggestions and encouragement) peer feedback affect argumentative writing and feedback characteristics through an experiment among 90 university students. Content analysis revealed that AI-supported peer feedback enhances elaboration of writing. Epistemic Network Analysis showed that AI-assisted condition fostered integration of cognitive (problem identification, elaboration) and affective (mitigation, hedging) elements, whereas AI-directed condition yielded more structured, task-focused revisions. These findings highlight the impacts of AI support on peer feedback characteristics and argumentative writing, underscoring the importance of cognitive efficiency and socio-emotional engagement in AI-supported peer feedback.\nAERA: American Educational Research Association.\n2025 # ISLS Annual Meeting 2025, Helsinki, Finland ISLS Symposia: “Learners’ Collaboration with AI in Enhancing Peer Feedback Literacy” (with Wenli Chen, Qianru Lyu, Lishan Zheng). Human-AI Collaboration Peer feedback constitutes a reciprocal loop where learners provide, receive, and act upon reviews of each other’s work, fostering both learning performance and high-order skills. However, its complex nature challenges learners’ feedback literacy as they progress along the “Ladder of Feedback”. Integrating AI into peer feedback mitigates the limitations of traditional approaches by offering real-time and personalized information, empowering learners to craft feedback or revise their work based on feedback received. Recent advancements in generative AI have transformed its role from an automated feedback source (i.e., AI-generated feedback) to an interactive, collaborative partner (i.e., AI-supported feedback) throughout the feedback process. While prior research has predominantly focused on “AI as a tool” to promote learning performance, questions remain regarding how learners perceive and collaborate with “AI as a partner” in enhancing feedback and its effectiveness compared with traditional peer feedback. This study aims to explore AI’s role across various feedback stages and provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI can be better designed to support students’ peer feedback activity.\nPoster: “Uncovering How Individual Preparation Shapes Collaborative Communication Patterns Through Epistemic Network Analysis” (with Wenli Chen, Lishan Zheng). Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) This study examines how individual preparation (IP) before collaboration influences learners’ verbal communication during collaborative learning. By comparing immediate collaboration with collaboration following IP, this study employed the Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to investigate the differences in learners’ verbal discourse patterns. The results indicate that while IP before collaboration fosters more structured communication, marked by enhanced task coordination and responsiveness, it reduces spontaneous negotiation. The findings suggest a trade-off between structured preparedness and flexibility, with implications for optimizing collaborative learning design.\nLong Paper: “Mental Effort and Task Performance During Collaboration: The Impact of Group Awareness” (with Wenli Chen, Lishan Zheng). Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) This study investigated the role of group awareness in supporting collaborative learning by examining its impact on mental effort (as measured by brain activation levels) and task performance during collaboration activities. 70 individuals from a university were recruited, with mental effort measured from the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) region of the brain using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and task performance was assessed under two collaborative learning conditions: with and without group awareness. The results showed that learners performed significantly better on the task with group awareness, but exhibited significantly greater mental effort without group awareness, suggesting that group awareness facilitated improvements in learners’ collaborative learning performance while reducing the learners’ mental effort for task completion. Researchers and educators could consider incorporating group awareness tools to allow learners to view and track each other’s contributions, progress, and engagement levels, to manage students’ mental demands and foster their collaborative learning performance.\nISLS: International Society of the Learning Sciences.\nAERA Annual Meeting 2025, Denver, Colorado, USA AERA Poster (Accepted): “Generative Artificial Intelligence and Job Displacement: A Perspective from College Entrance Examination” (with Peikang Zhang). Economics of Education As global economy transitions into digital era, generative AI is sparking concerns over job displacement and triggering risk-averse decision-making among college entrance exam candidates regarding their major choices, to whom existing research pays inadequate attention. This study introduces a novel perspective by using O*NET, NCEE, and population surveys to calculate major-level employment substitution rates. We reveal that the emergence of ChatGPT notably decreased admission scores due to heightened job displacement risks, particularly in STEM majors and Tier 1 colleges, and further investigate its demand-supply mechanism in job postings and graduate surveys. Our findings withstand extensive robustness checks, offering new insights into the dynamics of education and labor markets, enhancing human capital theory, and informing policies for optimizing educational resource allocations.\n2024 # BERA Annual Meeting and WERA Focal Meeting 2024, Manchester, UK BERA Individual Paper, Session Chair: “Research on the Influence Mechanism of Self-Regulated Learning Behaviors on Second Language Learning”.
